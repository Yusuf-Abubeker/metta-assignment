symbol-exists function correctly determines whether a given symbol is present in the tree.

Initialization:

left-child Function:
 Retrieves the left child of a node structured as ($node $left $right), where $left is the left child.
 Designed to handle nodes and extract the left child directly from the node structure.

right-child Function:
 Retrieves the right child of a node structured as ($node $left $right), where $right is the right child.
 Designed to handle nodes and extract the right child directly from the node structure.

root Function:
 Retrieves the root of a node structured as ($node $left $right), where $node is the root.
 Designed to handle nodes and extract the root directly from the node structure.

symbol-exists? Function:
 Checks if a given symbol exists in the tree.
 Designed to compare the symbol with the root, left child, and right child of the tree.

Maintenance:

left-child Function:
 Consistently returns the left child for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the left child.

right-child Function:
 Consistently returns the right child for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the right child.

root Function:
 Consistently returns the root for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the root.

symbol-exists? Function:
 Ensures accurate symbol existence check by comparing the symbol with the root, left child, and right child of the tree. Uses nested if statements to handle comparisons.

Termination:

left-child Function:
 Always terminates by returning the left child extracted from the node tuple.

right-child Function:
 Always terminates by returning the right child extracted from the node tuple.

root Function:
 Always terminates by returning the root extracted from the node tuple.

symbol-exists? Function:
 The function terminates by returning 'True' if the symbol matches the root, left child, or right child of the tree, otherwise returns 'False'.

Example:
Given the tree (a b d), the function call !(symbol-exists? (a b d) b) proceeds as follows:

It checks if b is the root (a), which it is not.
It then checks if b is the left child (b), which it is.
The function returns 'True'.
