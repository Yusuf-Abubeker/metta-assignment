count-symbol is that it counts occurrences of the specified symbol in the tree.

Initialization:

left-child Function:
 Retrieves the left child of a node structured as ($node $left $right).
 Initializes by handling nodes and extracting the left child directly from the node structure.

right-child Function:
 Retrieves the right child of a node structured as ($node $left $right).
 Initializes by handling nodes and extracting the right child directly from the node structure.

root Function:
 Retrieves the root of a node structured as ($node $left $right).
 Initializes by handling nodes and extracting the root directly from the node structure.

null? Function:
 Checks if a node is null by comparing it with ().
 Initializes by performing a comparison to determine if the node is null.

leaf? Function:
 Checks if a node is a leaf (i.e., has no children).
 Initializes by verifying if both left and right children of the node are null using the null? function.

equal? Function:
 Compares two symbols for equality.
 Initializes by performing a comparison between two symbols.

count-symbol Function:
 Counts the occurrences of a symbol in a tree.
 Initializes by checking if the tree is a leaf using the leaf? function and comparing the symbol using the equal? function.

Maintenance:

left-child and right-child Functions:
 Maintain consistent return of the left and right children for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the children.

root Function:
 Maintains consistent return of the root for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the root.

null? Function:
 Maintains accurate nullity checks by comparing the node with (), ensuring reliable null checks.

leaf? Function:
 Maintains accurate leaf identification by checking that both children are null. Uses null? function to verify the absence of children.

equal? Function:
 Maintains accurate comparison by checking if two symbols are equal.

count-symbol Function:
 Maintains accurate count of symbols by recursively traversing the tree. Adds the counts from the left and right subtrees and ensures that the current node's symbol is compared correctly.

Termination:

left-child, right-child, and root Functions:
 Always terminate by returning the left child, right child, or root extracted from the node tuple.

null? and equal? Functions:
 Terminate by returning true or false based on whether the node is null or the symbols are equal.

leaf? Function:
 Terminates by returning true if both children are null, otherwise false.

count-symbol Function:
 Terminates by returning 1 if the tree is a leaf and the symbol matches, otherwise 0. If the tree is not a leaf, it terminates by summing the counts from the left and right subtrees.
