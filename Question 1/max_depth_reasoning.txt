we're interested in is that the max-depth function correctly 
 calculates the maximum depth of the tree at each recursive call.

Initialization:

leftchild Function:
 Retrieves the left child of a node structured as ($node $left $right), where $left is the left child.
 Designed to handle nodes and extract the left child directly from the node structure.

rightchild Function:
 Retrieves the right child of a node structured as ($node $left $right), where $right is the right child.
 Designed to handle nodes and extract the right child directly from the node structure.

null? Function:
 Checks if a node is null by comparing it with ().
 Designed to perform a comparison to determine if the node is null.

leaf? Function:
 Checks if a node is a leaf (i.e., has no children).
 Designed to verify if both left and right children of the node are null using the null? function.

maxdepth Function:
 Calculates the maximum depth of a tree.
 Begins by checking if the provided node is a leaf using the leaf? function.

Maintenance:

leftchild Function:
 Consistently returns the left child for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the left child.

rightchild Function:
 Consistently returns the right child for any valid node structure, ensuring correct access to the right child.

null? Function:
 Accurately determines nullity by comparing the node with (), ensuring reliable null checks.

leaf? Function:
 Ensures accurate leaf identification by checking that both children are null. Uses null? function to verify the absence of children.

maxdepth Function:
 Recursively calculates the depth of left and right subtrees, ensuring that each subtreeâ€™s depth is computed 
 and the maximum is correctly determined. Adds 1 to account for the current node.

Termination:

leftchild Function:
 Always terminates by returning the left child extracted from the node tuple.

rightchild Function:
 Always terminates by returning the right child extracted from the node tuple.

null? Function:
 Terminates by returning true or false based on whether the node is null.

leaf? Function:
 Terminates by returning true if both children are null, otherwise false.

maxdepth Function:
 Recursion terminates when a leaf node is reached, returning a depth of 1. 
 The function then calculates and returns the maximum depth of the tree.
