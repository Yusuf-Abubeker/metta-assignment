Loop Invariant:
 For a tree, the invariant we're interested in is that the max-depth function correctly 
 calculates the maximum depth of the tree at each recursive call.

Initialization:
When the tree is empty, the depth is 0. This correctly represents the maximum depth of an empty tree.
Maintenance:
For a non-empty tree, the function calculates the depth of each subtree and takes the maximum value,
 adding 1 to account for the current level. The max function correctly keeps track of the deepest subtree encountered, 
 thus maintaining the invariant that the maximum depth is being correctly calculated at each step.

Termination:
 When all nodes have been processed, the maximum depth returned is accurate because the function 
 recursively computes the depth of each subtree and returns the greatest depth found plus one.
  The function terminates when all nodes have been evaluated, and the depth of the entire tree is correctly determined.
